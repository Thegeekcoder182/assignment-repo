# Database Optimization

In this section, we outline the database optimization strategies implemented to enhance the performance of our WordPress application.

## Indexing

### Table: wp_posts

- **Column**: post_title
  - **Type**: VARCHAR(200)
  - **Index Type**: FULLTEXT
  - **Rationale**: We created a FULLTEXT index on the `post_title` column to improve search query performance. This optimization is particularly valuable for searching posts by title.

### Table: wp_comments

- **Column**: comment_post_id
  - **Type**: BIGINT(20)
  - **Index Type**: INDEX
  - **Rationale**: An INDEX was added to the `comment_post_id` column to expedite comment retrieval for individual posts. This enhancement significantly improves the speed of loading comments for specific posts.

## Query Optimization

### Query 1: Retrieve Recent Pages

- **SQL Query**: SELECT * FROM wp_posts WHERE post_type = 'page' ORDER BY post_date DESC LIMIT 5
  - **Optimization**: We revised the query to select only the necessary columns and exclude those that are not required for the specific use case. This optimization reduces the amount of data retrieved from the database, making the query more efficient.

### Query 2: Retrieve Recent Comments

- **SQL Query**: SELECT * FROM wp_comments WHERE comment_post_id = 123 ORDER BY comment_date LIMIT 10
  - **Optimization**: An INDEX was created on the `comment_post_id` column to optimize the query. This leads to faster retrieval of comments for a specific post, especially when dealing with a large number of comments.

## Caching

- **Caching Mechanism**: Object Caching with Memcached
  - **Configuration**: Object caching using Memcached has been implemented to reduce the database load. Frequently used objects are stored in memory, resulting in quicker data retrieval.

- **Caching Mechanism**: Page Caching with W3 Total Cache Plugin
  - **Configuration**: The W3 Total Cache plugin has been configured to cache pages. This reduces the need for frequent database queries, resulting in improved page load times.

These optimization measures are meticulously designed to enhance the performance of our WordPress application. Each step has been thoughtfully considered to achieve specific performance benefits, ensuring that the database operates efficiently and responsively.
