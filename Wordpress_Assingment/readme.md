## Project Structure

- `Dockerfile`: This file contains the Dockerfile for the WordPress application.
- `docker-compose.yml`: The Docker Compose file that orchestrates the WordPress and MySQL containers.
- `uploads.ini`: A configuration file to adjust PHP upload settings.
- `database_optimization.md`: Documentation of database optimization steps and rationale.
- `my-wordpress/`: A directory containing the WordPress files.
- `scripts/`: (Optional) Directory for any additional scripts or automation.

## Prerequisites

- Docker: Ensure that Docker is installed on your system.

## Setup

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   docker-compose up --build


3. Access the WordPress site in your web browser at http://localhost:8000.

Database Optimization

For details on the database optimization strategies implemented in this project, please refer to the database_optimization.md file.

Additional Notes

Database backups are not implemented by default. Consider setting up regular database backups for data recovery.
Health checks for the WordPress container have been added for monitoring its availability. You can adjust the health check parameters in the Docker Compose file.
Custom network configuration is optional and has been included in the Docker Compose file but commented out. Uncomment and customize it if needed.
