Welcome to our WordPress adventure in the world of Docker! In this guide, we'll show you how we've harnessed the power of docker with the help of containers.

1. The Journey Begins:
Our project is all about making WordPress as cool and efficient as it can be. We've put WordPress inside a Docker container, and we've given its database a big boost to ensure it runs at its very best.

2. Getting Set Up

Prerequisites
Before we set sail, make sure you have Docker installed on your computer. It's your ticket to the world of containers. 

You can find docker desktop at this link: https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/

3. Ready to Set Sail
Run this command to clone the project to your local machine (replace <repository-url> with the repository URL): git clone {repository-url}

Now navigate to the project directory:cd {project-directory}


4. Sailing into Docker Waters:
Run this command to build the Docker images and set sail with our containers: docker-compose up --build

Edit: To use the above command you need to use your previously created wordpress image and set up the directry and all other neceserry information
inside the docker-compose.yaml file. Refer to this document for reference: https://docs.docker.com/compose/

Now, open your web browser and steer it to http://localhost:8000. 

You've now arrived at your very own WordPress island.


5. Optimizing the Heart of WordPress:
We didn't stop at simple containerization; Dive into our Database Optimization Guide at "https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E11882_01/server.112/e41573/toc.htm" to discover the secrets behind our optimization techniques.


6. In the Know and Handy Tips:
Staying Safe: While we're not automating database backups in this journey, remember to schedule regular backups for your precious data.
A Healthy Ship: We've added health checks to our WordPress container to ensure it's always on its toes and to keep its ehath in check.


Here i have added some commands which can be useful for you moving forward

Step 1: Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/trulymittal/wordpress-docker-compose.git

Step 2: cd into the repo
cd wordpress-docker-compose

Step 3: Run the containers
docker-compose up -d

To stop the containers
docker-compose down

To stop the containers and remove volumes
docker-compose down --volumes



Conclusion:
We hope you enjoy your journey into the world of Dockerized WordPress! If you have any questions, face challenges, or just want to chat about your experiences, don't hesitate to get in touch.

Happy sailing and optimizing!
